# The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccinations on Local Retail Sales in Washington State

The severity of COVID-19 continues to be a debated topic. Many right-wing activists and politicians have claimed the gravity of the pandemic is overblown and that mandatory vaccinations, masking, and “stay-at-home” policies have infringed on the freedoms of citizens.  In steep contrast, their left-wing counterparts believe that such sacrifices are necessary to slow the infection rate of COVID-19 and preserve human life. The politicization of the disease has resulted in a unique scenario in which areas with differing political perspectives will have vastly different COVID-19 policies. Such policies have affected local businesses in unique ways as they dictate the behavior of the possible clients of businesses.

Despite the growth of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart during the pandemic, many local businesses witnessed a downturn in revenue due to COVID-19. These local businesses did not have a large internet presence and, consequently, relied on in-person customers for their revenue. In left-leaning cities like Seattle, government policies and a strong media presence decreased the number of people willing to go outside their homes, resulting in fewer clients for local businesses. Meanwhile, more right-leaning cities like Miami witnessed huge infection rates which physically stopped clients from appearing at businesses with ailments and decreased employment due to fears of contracting COVID-19. In both cases, COVID-19 caused economic repercussions for local businesses, but how has following the separate ideologies, avoiding COVID-19 vs. ignoring COVID-19, affected the revenues of local businesses? Does it make a difference in the economic recovery of businesses? In our analysis, we hope to answer such questions. 

Our group localized our observations to local retailers in Washington state where we will observe the trend of revenues per city. Using data about local retail sales from 2015 to 2022, we can observe how sales were affected by social isolation during 2020 in comparison to the years prior and how the businesses recovered during 2021 and 2022. Because there isn’t necessarily a way to rank cities by their “reigning ideologies about COVID-19”, we have decided to organize cities by their county’s percentage of vaccinated citizens as vaccination rates are correlated with a population’s sentiment about the severity of COVID-19. By organizing cities by vaccination rate, we can observe how higher vaccination rates in some cities have affected the percentage increase/decrease in local retailer revenue over the prior, during, and post-COVID periods. This, consequently, will answer questions about how differing ideologies on how to deal with COVID-19 have affected the revenues of local businesses.

Answering questions about the economic impact of COVID-19 on local business revenue is important as it may provide insight into how we should deal with future pandemics/epidemics. As of right now, the U.S. is going through an economic downturn with rising inflation rates partially due to the repercussions of COVID-19. During the pandemic, many witnessed panic buying/saving, widespread isolation policies, working-from-home policies, etc. for the first time, and in consideration of these events, many politicians struggled with balancing the economy with the prevention of COVID-19. Our analysis may provide a good starting point for research into how events spawning from a pandemic can affect our economy and, consequently, help lawmakers make more educated choices in the policies to deal with disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected this data through the use of vaccination providers that partnered with the CDC: jurisdictional partner clinics, retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and Services Administration partner sites, and federal entity facilities. Submissions made by these partners contain data about the dose number, manufacturer, date administered and recipient ID of the people receiving vaccines which were then organized by county.

[The impact of COVID-19 on small business outcomes and expectations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006991117#:~:text=Across%20the%20full%20sample%2C%2043,being%20less%20of%20a%20factor.)  
* Small businesses account for 50% of all employment in the US, yet they have been having the hardest time during the pandemic
* Any policies that help sustain businesses during the economic shutdown have a very high return for the economy  

[Businesses Must Accept ‘COVID-stasis’ and Adapt for the Future of Work](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-28/businesses-must-accept-covid-stasis-and-adapt-for-the-future-of-work)  
* Human behavior is resistant to change, once people were forced to work remotely, reverting back to a primarily in person work environment became very difficult, companies that betted against this are suffering now. Small businesses don't benefit from the shift to online work. 
* Companies that have pivoted into the remote environment early in the pandemic have reaped many rewards, catering to the new social distancing demands. Article focused primarily on bigger companies while we will observe the changes to small businesses

[Tracking the COVID-19 Economy’s Effects on Food, Housing, and Employment Hardships](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-economys-effects-on-food-housing-and#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20jobs%20lost,to%20Labor%20Department%20employment%20data.)  
* A large portion of jobs displaced due to the pandemic had lower wages, whereas high wage jobs were barely affected (national average). 
* Generally, traditionally red states have been the most affected in the following areas: food acquisition difficulty, being caught up on rent, covering household expenses, and employment. We will look specifically into right-leaning sreas of Washington to see how small businesses fared instead of individuals

[COVID-19 Policy Differences across US States: Shutdowns, Reopening, and Mask Mandates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766317/)  
* A rise in daily cases have pushed states to impose border restrictions or shutdowns but has no effect on decisions to enforce a mask mandate, let it be noted that mask mandates were statistically more effective in reducing cases than state border shutdowns
* Reopening borders was a response to the rise in unemployment whereas mask mandate implementations had a correlation with the political alignment of states. These differing policies affected their small businesses accordingly. We will observe the implications of policies rather than the policies themselves. 

[Tourism-dependent economies are among those harmed the most by the pandemic](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/12/impact-of-the-pandemic-on-tourism-behsudi)  
* The restriction on travel due to the pandemic has severely impacted the tourism industry in many countries. This reduced the tourism in many big cities like Seattle, hurting the small businesses there
* The crisis in the tourism industry and travel and hospitality sectors has driven less developed countries to invest more into different areas of their economy
