                claimed the gravity of the pandemic is overblown and that mandatory vaccinations, masking, and “stay-at-home” 
                policies have infringed on the freedoms of citizens. In steep contrast, their left-wing counterparts believe 
                that such sacrifices are necessary to slow the infection rate of COVID-19 and preserve human life. The politicization 
                of the disease has resulted in a unique scenario in which areas with differing political perspectives will have vastly
                different COVID-19 policies. Such policies have affected local businesses in unique ways as they dictate the behavior 
                of the possible clients of businesses."),
              p("Despite the growth of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart during the pandemic, many local businesses witnessed 
                a downturn in sales due to COVID-19. These local businesses did not have a large internet presence and, consequently,
                relied on in-person customers for their sales. In left-leaning cities like Seattle, government policies and a strong
                media presence decreased the number of people willing to go outside their homes, resulting in fewer clients for local
                businesses. Meanwhile, more right-leaning cities like Miami witnessed huge infection rates which physically stopped 
                clients from appearing at businesses with ailments and decreased employment due to fears of contracting COVID-19.
                In both cases, COVID-19 caused economic repercussions for local businesses, but how has following the separate ideologies,
                avoiding COVID-19 vs. ignoring COVID-19, affected the saless of local businesses? Does it make a difference in the economic
                recovery of businesses? In our analysis, we hope to answer such questions."),

                2020 in comparison to the years prior and how the businesses recovered during 2021 and 2022. Because there isn’t necessarily a
                way to rank cities by their “reigning ideologies about COVID-19”, we have decided to organize cities by their county’s percentage
                of vaccinated citizens as vaccination rates are correlated with a population’s sentiment about the severity of COVID-19. By
                organizing cities by vaccination rate, we can observe how higher vaccination rates in some cities have affected the percentage
                increase/decrease in local retailer sales over the prior, during, and post-COVID periods. This, consequently, will answer
                questions about how differing ideologies on how to deal with COVID-19 have affected the sales of local businesses."),

                long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and Services Administration 
                partner sites, and federal entity facilities. Submissions made by these partners contain data about the dose number, manufacturer, 
                date administered and recipient ID of the people receiving vaccines which were then organized by county. We took special notice of the series completed
                columns which indicated percentage/number of population who have completed the primary series of vaccinations for COVID-19. We also
                took census population information from this to get an idea of the population of each county. In addition to the data from the CDC, 
                we looked at revenue data from Washington State Department of Revenue: \"Taxable Retail Sales\". The Department of Revenue of Washington State collects 
                data through tax returns where businesses are supposed to list their sales and type of store. After grouping counties together in this dataset, we
